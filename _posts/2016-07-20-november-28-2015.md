We have a Plastic-problem, and we're not talking about the social "image" one is encouraged to maintain, we're talking about an actual issue causing extinctions of entire families of species upon our planet, us included. And it is an INCREASINGLY damaging issue.

Plastic that ends up in the oceans eventually find themselves in the so called "sixth continent", "the Garbage Patch of the Pacific". Or any of the other Wave Gyres where it'll deteriorate down to particulates and become part of everything we eat and drink.

Toothbrushes, which are believed to be one of the solutions to prevent our teeth from rotting, is one of those things that most people would prefer not to think too much about, as long as their teeth are clean. As recommended by oral hygienists, toothbrush are only effective to be used for a few months after which it becomes "ineffective" and should be replaced. What most of us don't really think about is how much of this small plastic that have been thrown out to the landfills & in the oceans. And we all know, since recycling has been increasingly growing each year, that plastic does not deteriorate well in nature. More than three billion plastic toothbrushes end up in landfills, every year! That's a massive amount of plastic!

One of the solution that has been found for this is a type of toothbrush that is made out of plants --[boobam brush][0]. The handle is made out of 100% biodegradable bamboo which naturally provides a non-slip surface. Bamboo is one of the fastest growing plant on earth. It is naturally antibacterial which means that there is no need to use fertilizers or pesticides during its cultivation.

The bristles have been verified to be free from the toxin BPA (bisphenol A). The bristles are made out of nylon 4, a durable innovative biodegradable material. So far, there is no other plant-based material yet to be found that would allow to use your brush for the recommended three months.

**"Be the change you want to see in the world." -- Mahatma Gandhi**

Change does not always come as a revolution, but a lot of small changes make mountains move. Start by making the right choice. In daily life, the way we produce and the way we consume products. You have that power, by making the right choices.

Now you can make a small change to your toothbrush buying habit and choose a [natural boobam toothbrush][1] over a common plastic one.
